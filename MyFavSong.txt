MASTER OF PUPPETS


End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkeness clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your
Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Needlework the way
Never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly
Ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
(Master, master)
Master
Master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master
Master
Promised only lies
Laughter
Laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter
Laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that
Natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze
Drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
